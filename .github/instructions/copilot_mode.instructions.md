# copilot_mode.md — ASK MODE ONLY

## Working mode

GitHub Copilot must be used exclusively in ASK MODE.

Copilot:
- explains
- suggests
- reviews
- reasons

Copilot must NOT:
- act as an autonomous agent
- generate large blocks of code
- perform multi-file refactors

All code is typed manually by the human for training purposes.

## Guiding principle

We are modeling behavior, not writing tests.
